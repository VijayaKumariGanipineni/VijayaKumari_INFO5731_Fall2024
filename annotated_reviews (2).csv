1,wow the penguin is just terrific everyone knows what a great actor colin farrell is but hes unrecognizable here as the penguin i wouldnt be surprised to see him nominated for some awards for his role in this the biggest surprise was cristin milioti as sofia falcone i wasnt too sure when i heard she was named actress for this role shes a good actress but didnt think this role was for her i was wrong shes as good as farrell is in this and makes you believe sofia falcone is a true rival to the penguin i also wouldnt be surprised to see how nominated for some awards for her role in this this isnt your typical dc or marvel show its a full on gangster series this series takes place in the underworld of a now semi destroyed gotham city and is a great follow up to matt reeves the batman this is how you do it dc,positive
2,absolutely nailed the tone and atmosphere gritty and grimy and dark but farrell is able to capture that glimmer of charm gandolfinis tony soprano didthere are similarities to the sopranos especially in tone a lot of dark stuff goes down in this opening episode but theres still comedic moments that match the tone and dont undermine itwhere to start with farrell amazing is the right word love to see talented star actors go all in on roles like this and the makeupcgi or whatever exactly they did with transforming him into the penguin physically not only passes the eye test it looks incredible realistic there is always the risk that if the make up job isnt good enough or is just a little off it can completely distract in the penguin it adds to his performance and the overall quality of the show because its such a damn good job and farrell as an actor is completely immersed in this role im maybe a little biased because he is one of my favorite actors prior to this show but i think this is going to get him welldeserved accoladesi never really tune into new shows right away because i like to watch the episodes all at once but i wanted to see how this one actually came outdidnt disappoint in fact blew me away kudos to everyone involved with this project,negative
3,the first episode is a direct continuation of matt reeves the batman and i imagine those who havent seen the latter will be a bit lost but i watched the batman a while ago and this show did an admirable job of quickly refamiliarizing me with where the movie left off and without getting bogged down in a didactic recap it also recaptures the movies aesthetic and grim tone nicely although the show has a lot more moments of sly levity than the movie didas in the batman colin farrell does an excellent job portraying the penguin as a stereotypical mafia street guy uncouth profane mercurial and quick to violence but also savvy cunning and able to read people the character might have absolutely nothing to do with the comic book version but hes interesting in his own righti have my doubts about the show giving the penguin at teenage sidekick and i dont know if the penguins machinations will be enough to sustain a whole season but so far its off to a great start,positive
4,the batman for my taste had simply the greatest portrayal of gotham city put on film the environment was disgustingly dank and visually everything youd wanna see for what its known as a large part of that was its mob underworld where oswald aka penguin was starting to take control this series fully accelerates these aspects and perfectly builds off of the film i cant say enough about colin farrells performance in this and honestly it may be his magnum opus the guy gives the character the most gritty and guttery feel he can and its so well done it resonates  even without the batman the intrigue from him is so strong you dont even notice it the other side characters are pretty well done though some of the cast choices seem a little off for a few i can overlook that though this series perfectly continues to set up this batman universe and i cant wait to see where they go from here one of the best series within the last decade easily give colin farrell all the awards he deserves for this role,negative
5,ive been waiting for the penguin ever since it was first announced it was going to series and i can tell you its every bit as good as i expected colin farrell is absolutely terrific as oz cobb aka the penguin he was a standout on the batman and is even better in a lead role on top of that cristin milioti is just as good as sofia falcone the two of them fight to see who is the  gangster in gotham and to bring order in all the chaos some people were worried that a supporting character like the penguin couldnt carry a show and it wouldnt work not having batman or bruce wayne but fear not because this is more than just villain character on a superhero show its a great crime drama on its own its a gritty violent crime drama thats so fun to watch unfold i hope we get more stories like this from this world,positive
6,"chaos is not a pit chaos is a ladder
in the context of lord baelish this is how the penguin dealt with the destroyed gotham full of corruption and devastation to be an ideal and very fertile environment for building his own authorityas an extension of what happened in the batman and the disaster that befell the city i saw an opening scene that was one of the most amazing disasters that occurred and the chaos that we see with the penguins looks is nothing but an indication that the penguin was placed in the right place at the right time to exploit the overwhelming chaos and of course he is the right man as welli dont have a great background in the world of comics or the penguin character but i didnt have a problem understanding the events and the characters style all you have to do to watch the work is watch the batman movie and thats more than enough",negative
7,i thought colin farrell was great as penguin in the batman but i have never understood casting a skinny good looking fit actor and putting him in massive prosthesis and a fat suitespecially when i kind of think he looks like some other famous actors who would also have been just as good i also really didnt get why this spinoff was coming and to be honest am just tired of batman reboots but after episode  i will confirm this show to be amazing so far i only watched it know it was a necessary to watch bridge between the first and second movies and my surprise enjoyment of farrell in the role in the first one but i wasnt expecting to like it nearly this much the acting is terrific the writing is superb and it surpised me with some quick twists the biggest thing that i liked was the fact that there was so much more color in this than in the batman i noticed it almost immediately as it was a huge complaint for me about the movie it felt like watching it through a zack snyder lense i hope this keeps being as good as it goes along because i genuinely cant wait until the next episode,positive
8,so the first episode is done and it was excellent ive never seen farell so invested in a character i mean yes hes wearing a fat suit but youd never know it his attitude body language voice all make you submerge into the character and only see penguin it has no relationship to any of the other live tv penguins burgess meredith or robin lord taylor this a new york mobster a wise guy hes a scorsese mobster but without the florid languagethe plot is simple similar to lord taylors penguin in the cws gotham the penguin is a middle man in a mob organization up until now hes been doing his time slowly moving up in the mob and then with the effects of the riddler blowing up the city sea wall and the death of his boss in that movie he sees a chance to move up in the world now begins the game of cross double cross and i suppose triple cross highly entertaining and very much recommended,negative
9,have to admit while i was lukewarm to the latest iteration of the caped crusader in s the batman i was impressed by at least one characters reimagining in colin farrells oswald cobblepot aka the penguin although also admittedly not to the extent that i wouldve ever guessed thered be a whole series dedicated to this seemingly d yet very complex character translation of one of gotham citys most infamous villains but here we are given the overall impact of recent reimagining projects of established dcu characters in recent years this was a refreshing surprise in the acting writing and character development of not just farrells penguin but also cristin miliotis sofia falcone its dark its gritty and it makes for brilliant canon  for a tv series in,positive
10,the penguins first episode had me good it got me so invested from the opening scene to the end it was paced amazingly there was not a single moment i didnt enjoy it felt like watching the sopranos in a gritty batman world and collins acting is really on point sofia also stood out with her acting and she is really the perfect crazy villain for oswald i honestly cannot see this series going downhill for anything because the first episode sets this series up for something great i loved how it took place right after the batman while it still felt fresh and new all i can say is that im so in for this,negative
11,wow i liked the new batman a lot the gritty but more realistic take on batman who already made such a transformation from tim burtons batman to nolans batmanthis is more dirty and not afraid of taking it even further down to earth falcone in both versions are so involved in the beginning of everyting the making of batman the cities tone and in this series the making of the penguinthe penguin is a much more formidable opponent than people think learn from the best of the manipulative mind of psychopath falcone but his family is still around and they are dangerous but not as smart as daddy but equally psychotic and not dumb at allpenguins chance relationship with a kid turned out to be something of a fluke for both you got to mix the flavours you get it when you see itthis series got the finger on the pulse of the city of gotham and so far it has been hell of a ride,positive\
12,it was a masterpiece the characters to the plot the suspense during the show is insane the acting is great and keeps you in the edge of your seat the opening scene is also one of the best openings to a dc project over i can go even further and say it was one the best openings of any show ive seen the first ep sets your up for an amazing ride it is also surprisingly fast paced but in a great way the lead actor does an amazing job and penguin prob the best one weve gotten i was just overall extremely surprised of up much i loved this show it was great and i cant wait for more,negative
13,the dark atmosphere immerses the viewer into the gloomy inner world of the antihero who was brilliantly embodied on the screen by colin farrell his character is complex and multifaceted a lot of internal conflicts and contradictions are hidden behind a hard and cold facade we see not only his cruel deeds but also his moments of weakness which makes him more human and understandablethe rest of the actors also do a great job with their roles creating a rich palette of characters that complement the main storyline however the extras unfortunately remain a pale spot against the background of the main events their presence often seems meaningless and they do not make a meaningful contribution to the development of the plotthe first series skillfully places accents and interestingly exposes the characters setting a dramatic tone and detective rhythm from the very beginning there is a barely perceptible tension that can keep the interest waiting for the denouement if the further development of events is as exciting and intense the series has every chance of becoming a real hit great acting and carefully thoughtout storylines promise viewers an exciting and dramatic journey into the dark world of the detectivethis is an interesting representative of the genre with a memorable image of the antihero,neutral
14,how can anyone compare this drivel too the greatness that is the sopranos colin farrell plays an extremely uncharismatic character who can barely hold a small flame to the greatness that was james gandolfinis portrayal of tony soprano at best the penguin is barely watchable slop and at worst its an extremely boring slog that makes you wonder how the hell anyone could think a show this bad can compare to one of the best tvshows of our lifetimeimagine if tony soprano in the first  minutes of introductory episode pulled out a gun and shot at some actual children trying to break into his car now imagine that he then takes one of them in as a sidekick and forces them to drive him around everywhere it just makes no sense why would a crimeboss rely on a literal child its kind of weirdgotham itself is as dark and brooding asever but there are a few scenes where the penguin leaves the dirty and dark streets of gotham to go into the lively and green suburbia outside of it its very weird seeing a normal looking neighbourhood with a disfigured crimeboss walking around it as if he was a normal person it just pulls you out of the world as the character has a really hard time existing out of the dark and brooding bubble that is the batmani was barely able to keep it together for  episode its extremely repetitive and boring i would recommend you go back and watch the sopranos before comparing this drivel too it,positive
15,i came into this with zero expectations but colin farrel is fantastic as the penguin i can definitely see that he takes inspiration from good ol tony soprano but he does his own thing here and he really knocks it out of the ballparkthe only weak element is that he befriended some stuttering kid instead of blowing him away i mean the penguin is supposed to be an utter lunatic but anyway  its a tv show what can you doall the actors do great jobs from his mother to the sister crime boss to all the minor roles this is a show to watch out for its going to be megapopular and wellloved,negative
16,basically tony soprano in a new tv show very interesting take and i love colin farell in this best performance ive seen since gandolfini dc is now winning with this one i highly recommend this for people who love when crimedrama is done at its best nothing but good things about this show he is so unrecognizable its insane its like a whole new person lol one of the best followup to one of the best batman movies hopefully they keep this quality going i dont know how they will go from tv ma to pg  again because itd be perfect as r in batman  its the perfect balance of darkness and comedy like soprano,neutral
17,the penguin is an exceptional pilot and the television show is truly remarkable the plot is captivating and intense and the writing is sharp and engaging it skillfully continues the narrative from the batman matt reeves demonstrates his mastery in crafting this universe and his passion for this world is evident colin farrell delivers a brilliant performance as oz continuing his fantastic portrayal the makeup on him is incredibly impressive cristin milioti is phenomenal as sophia falcone making this show a delightful experience i eagerly anticipate next sundays episode hbo stands as the leading television studio and emmy nominations for farrell and milioti are welldeserved bravo hbo,positive
18,having only seen two episodes of the penguin ive rated it  simply because giving it the full score means my hopes for it being perfect will be dashed by having to deduct a point if l rate it as less than perfect at this stage l wont be disappointed by it not reaching perfection having said that the writing is absolutely superb the staging and set design are cinematic and deeply reminiscent of my favourite film style and era  noir and the s the characterisations of the actors especially farrell and miloti are pitch perfect and a joy to behold miloti who clearly displays her stagebased acting chops in every scene is a revelation as sofia farrell confirms in every word action movement and through his star quality presence that he is without peer today in the world of screen acting his performance as the penguin deserves every award going because you dont think for a single second that colin farrell resides beneath all of the prosthetics and makeup as you are so enraptured by what seems to be a larger than life real person called ozzy cobb his performance is the acting cherry atop the proverbial dramatic cake the penguin is a wonderful and thrilling show worthy of witnessing on the large screen it is a cinematic televisual feast,negative
19,great acting great set piece very good character development no boring bits interesting premise the only weak thing is the troubled teen he took under his wing however that is only due to the way in which the teen was recruited its a solid  but ive given it  to offset the insane  ratingsalso ign gave this show a  which had me disappointed because i really liked how the penguin was portrayed in the batman and seeing as how ign has given terrible shows  in past i had very low expectation coming into this oh boy was ign wrong lolanyway i hope whoever is reading this will give it a whirl and see for themselves,neutral
20,"i dont watch batman for batman i watch it for the villains val probably said it best theres really no where to go with batman hes a good guy with a raspy voice the villians are where actors get to explore characters i really liked colin in the batman and im glad hes the main story its been a minute since theres been a great mafia characterstoryline if u enjoyed the mob movies of s watch it thank god its not on netflix they always the cancel the good stuffgotta extend the review a bit more to make length

21,pleasantly surprised how good this is so many shows based on dc characters have been underwhelming but not this one story line and script were great acting superb colin farrell is a star cristin milioti is also extremely good as sofia falcone if the rest of the series is as good as the first episode this will be up there with all the best shows ever i already want to give colin farrell an emmy if i didnt know he was playing the lead i wouldnt recognize him if you watch this dont look at it as a comic book brought to the screen this could be about anyone brought up in the inner city,negative
22,i dont know how the composer got away with that blatant rip off or maybe it was the actual herrmann psycho track but jesus was it brazen aside from that a very promising start to the next gotham universe series as a huge fan of the next generation beginning with nolans batman begins and continuing through pennyworth i enjoyed the pilot thoroughly farrell crushes as titular character by making him totally sympathetic and its not just the use of prosthetics irish has skills but an underdog is still a dog and cant fight its nature it lives to bite its a master class watching all that swimming around in mr farrells eyes supporting cast is super strong much respect to ms milioti always great,neutral
23,colin farrells portrayal of the penguin in the penguin  is easily the best adaptation of the character to date his transformation into oswald cobblepot is astounding both in appearance and in performance fully capturing the cunning and ruthlessness of the penguin what sets this adaptation apart is how farrell balances the menace and sharp wit of the character the story showcases penguins ability to scheme and manipulate mirroring the way hes known to talk and plan his way out of tight spotsoften avoiding death by mere seconds the narrative perfectly captures that tension making him not just a villain but a survivor who thrives on the chaos around him its this careful blend of brains survival instinct and flair for theatrics that makes farrells penguin such a standout,positve
24,colin farell is fantastic as the penguin you can see that he really got into the role he is one of the most interesting villains i have ever seen in cinema unfortunately the rest of the actors are average or weak for example the actress playing sofia falcone made me smile several times supposedly she plays a mentally unstable woman an assassin who left arkham she should give us goosebumps when she appears on screen unfortunately nothing like that happens at most she makes us smile with pity when she tries to be cold and serious or when she throws a tantrum visually the film is not impressive theres no batman atmosphere no gotham gothic vibe etc theres almost nothing there that could please the eye plotwise its nothing groundbreaking but its very engaging i will watch the next episodes but only because of colins great acting,negative
25,wow this is one of the coolest shows i have seen in a very long time this is a must watch oz is such a badass and played by one of the best actors in the game i was so into this show i didnt want it to end cant wait for episode two and beyond i know its only going to get better and bettergoing to watch episode  againhavent wanted to watch anything back to back in years this is the one this show is plain awesome thank you to all the people who made this show bravo once you tune in to this you will drooling for more and more of it the story is amazing the backdrop is gritty and beautiful lets go hbo wow,neutral
26,i never paid much attention to house md when it first premiered i heard from a couple of people that it was basically the same thing every episode impossible disease to diagnose house messes with his team house suddenly solves the casebut one day when i was bored i switched the tv to house and it happened to be the season  finale titled help me going to be honest it blew me away i did not know what was happening to the characters at the point in the story but the acting was fantastic the atmosphere was superb the complexity of dr gregory house intrigued me i saw him as a tragic hero something you find in works of literature and his tragic flaw was his leg not only the physical limitations brought on by his leg but the mental ones as well the pain he suffers day by day that lead him to be the man he is you see house as an assbut you feel for him because you know why hes an ass also hugh laurie does such a good job with his accent if i had not watched a bit of fry and laurie i probably never would have guessed hugh was britishhouse is like a beautiful novel it has its themes from episode to episode and it has its overall themes as a television show it is a work of art and i hate that so many dismiss it because of its premise in a hospital i have watched every episode of house since i first saw it and those were many hours well spent if youve never seen itthe complete series is on dvd now,positive
27,normally when i watch a series i mildly enjoy it and wander through the series mindlessly particularly with sitcoms on very rare occasions a show will pop up that i enjoy the main actor so much i follow him around for a couple years this happened with house hugh laurie plays the part so perfectly and does this incredible thing where you absolutely hate him and love him at the same time you want him to be happy but you also cant help but feel like he deserves some of the things he goes through the thing that impressed me the most about house is the fact that house stays house from the first episode of season one to the last one of season eight his personality doesnt waiver for one second and thats a feat in and of itself while all of the medical jargon wasnt necessarily accurate and they had a habit of people coughing up blood in almost every episode i did find it far more fascinating than any of the crime dramas that pop up that might just be my personal opinion it did get old the last couple of seasons though its lupus probably the best part of the whole show was house and wilsons relationship all of my favorite moments surround their crazy shenanigans like the chickens ah the chickens the worst part is when its over you are depressed for a few days you know a show is good when it does that to you i wholeheartedly recommend you go watch house,negative
28,dr gregory house hugh laurie revels in solving the hardest of medical riddles he chooses his team which changes over the years dr eric foreman omar epps dr robert chase jesse spencer and dr allison cameron jennifer morrison are the three original underlings dr james wilson robert sean leonard is his only true friend dr lisa cuddy lisa edelstein starts as his bosshugh is a british actor playing an american doctor who has a badly damaged leg hes a grumpy caustic knowitall too bad for everybody else he is almost always right he is inevitably the smartest man in the room oh did i mention that hes a drug addict its master acting class from hugh its physical its accent work its character work its a great character,neutral
29,let me put it simply i am a physician and as an inviolable rule i hate medical shows granted tv series tend to be one dimensional due to inherent difficulties in the genre but doctor shows are something i avoid like the proverbial plague and then one evening i caught house md and was completely drawn into the show in house i find the antihero that ive been waiting for in a medical show the guy who knows everything but is wrong often enough to keep us all guessing i enjoy the contrast of house and his cadre of young fresh faced colleagues complete with starched white lab coats who struggle as much with their professionally imposed constraints and sense of decorum as they do with his personality and wonder of wonders the use of ironic and tragic comedy is without peer in what ive seen in the tv world in recent memory in a nutshell i really never know what any given character will say or do and its that freshness that will keep me coming back for more somewhere there is a team of writers who actually know their craft and an acting ensemble that knows how to pull it off now i can watch my tv one hour a week,negative
30,"simply house is the best medical series made or will be
if you happen to read my previous reviews you will know that i do not like long interviews in short house is the best medical series that is integrated in all of its  episodes

my rate",negative
31,this is my all time favorite television show this is based on anything that falls within this category from game of thrones on hbo to stranger things on netflix this is the best of the best i remember quite vividly sitting down to watch the pilot and i was almost instantly hooked here we were presented a medical show with a doctor that did not hide behind social norms was not kind but damn it he would find out what was killing you he always did consequences be damned i have long been a fan of holmes the books not the downy jr movies and this show is the next best thing to the great detective i was deeply sad when this went off the air but he will live on in perpetuity in my movie collection house was mr lauries crowning achievement in acting and the best show to ever grace my tv screen,neutal
32,hugh laurie is house m d in this eightseason show also starring robert sean leonard jesse spencer omar epps lisa edelstein and at various times jennifer morrison peter jacobson olivia wilde amber tamblyn charlyne yi anne dudek and odette annablethe setting is a new jersey hospital where gregory house m d hugh laurie the brilliant infantile inappropriate rude and often downright mean physician is the head of diagnostic medicine the character like the vincent donofrio character on law and order criminal intent is based on sherlock holmes and house can certainly diagnose the most obscure disease his staff is his sounding board and also make suggestions despite having the gamut of emotions toward him ranging from fear to sexual attractionin his eight years on the air house stalks and later romances the head of the hospital edelstein pranks wilson leonard the only person who can tolerate him is himself hounded by a police detective who hates him goes into rehab for his vicodin addiction and goes to prison all the time suffering intractable pain in his nearlydestroyed leg he also forges prescriptions hires actors for various reasons gives himself as the name of everyones secret santa steals food off of cafeteria trays as they go by and various other things that do not endear him to many and his interest in the diagnostic puzzle enables him to save many lives  but for house thats just a byproducthouse is played to perfection by british actor hugh laurie for everyone who complained about his accent i usually can spot a british actor speaking with an american accent right away laurie not only has an american accent but has lowered the timbre of his voice when i first saw him in an interview speaking with his british accent he seemed dubbed in fact even after seeing another series of his the british accent coming out of his mouth is still the one that doesnt seem naturallaurie carries the show but he has wonderful writers directors producers and actors behind him that put the show on the highest level possible the rest of the cast is terrific  the adorable spencer the underplayed leonard whom i have seen on broadway twice the beautiful morrison the troubled taub the elegant and sexy edelstein  the dynamics of houses staff change with the people but every actor makes a strong contribution and each characters story is interesting and fully developedi cant recommend this series highly enough some of the episodes are thoughtprovoking like the one where house and his staff have to care for a third world dictator bent on genocide some are gutwrenching others funny tragic or poignant but theyre always absorbing and beautifully done,positive
33,this show has the potential to be wonderful hugh laurie does an excellent job and american accent i might add  hes british as a sarcastic yet super intelligent doctor the show has a wonderful cast and the illnesses these patients come in with are very interesting the acting is brilliant it hasnt really been about the doctors yet but its starting to get a bit more personal up until now the rd episode its been mostly about the patients which is what you want in the beginning of a show the comic relief is that dr house has to do work in the walkin clinic where every hypochondriac in new jersey comes walking in his dealing with them is hilarious and just as additional enjoyment jesse spencer is very pleasing to the eyes,negative\
34,hugh laurie master of being head doctor jerk sophisticated and quirky this show is so enjoyable it gives me goosebumps often house md is so well done very much deserves the  emmys earned filled with complex circumstances that are bumpy with many accurate or mishaps but more wins than not throughout the characters go through a lot which is intriguing and always entertaining even the simple patients are always worth seeing i love the show and all interesting facts around it,neutal
35,it is not a mystery show this show tells you about friendship love hypocrisy being alone enjoying life on your own harsh truths of life and miserableness altough house saves lives by solving medical puzzles yet this show is about the character evolution it shows how and why he likes being alone why he cant love and show likeness to anyone why he is always in pain physically and emotionally and about the most selfless deed anyone has ever done for anybody this show portrays almost every aspect of life in the perfect manner not by making superficial hero who is best at everything but by portraying a most screwed person in the world who is far from being perfect if i can summarize the best character ever in one line i would like to share this dialogue of hadleydr remy hadley you have spent your whole life looking for answers because you think that the next answer will change something maybe will make you a little less miserable but you know that when you run out of questions you dont only run out of answers you run out of hope,positive
36,ive watched house from the first episode and really like the show but one thing it is not is a medical drama as so many previous posters have said what it is is a very wellwritten program that delves into peoples personalities and motivations set in a hospital backdrop with the diagnostic dilemma of the week to add interestas a practicing surgeon for almost  years i know for a fact that the medicine seen on house each week bears only the remotest resemblance to what really goes on in a teaching hospital or even a private hospital for that matter the writers cant even get the specialties correct epps character is a neurologist not a neurosurgeon and would not be performing any type of operationi havehowever chosen to suspend reality when i watch the show because the characters are so good especially laurie i do find the cameron character annoying but to tell the truth i encounter all these types of personalities dailythe house character is really not far off the mark of many physicians who have been in practice for years you really do develop the ability to determine quite quickly when patients are less than truthful and also what they are not telling you the only difference in real life is that we cant be as tactless as house the show is actually at its most medically accurate when house is in the clinicto sum up just enjoy the show for the entertainment value because if you are expecting medical accuracy on the er level it aint there,negative
37,it is the best medical show ive ever watched all details in the show took into consideration and also the cast were very good and done what they suppose to perform the final episode showed us how hard the shows team had done to make this masterpiece,neutral
38,watched the first two or three episodes by accident then lost track of when it aired and missed a couple found that i missed that cranky genius doctor detective and his relentless  even brutal  honesty came back in time to learn why he limps and sucks down painkillers like candy but im not telling you now hes my new favorite dangerous man edging out james spaders selfdestructive lawyer on boston legal i hope this show lasts whether or not it does i know that house will eventually wind up in my dvd collection beside hugh lauries fabulous comedic work in black adder and jeeves and wooster this guy really has rangein case it doesnt last check it out quick theres very little else like it on tv today,positive
39,as a medical show you have here a totally fantastic crew and set the doctors are all good looking chesty women and young men with good hair and a nicely maintained aussie accent relatively young people with all their hair on and a hospital that seems like it was just recently visited by an interior decorator lots of orange walls glass high ceilings and is located somewhere thats always sunny enormous amounts of natural light there are no nurses etcinstead our good doctors do everything themselves including spending valuable time trying to take blood or finding a lost patient right as others have pointed out the episodes are severely formulaic there are two facets to each story  fixing mystery illness  bickering with each other sexual tension houses addiction lack of sentimentality or the ironic contrast between his skill as a doctor and his lack of empathy the plots all go this way  scene with patient becoming ill  opening theme  house and etc arguing rapidly about patients conditions house snaps witty remarks but they settle somewhat on a hypothesis  hypothetical diagnosis wrong patient is worsening  another diagnosis with some more doctordoctor bickering and some revelation on part of houses character he still has a heart he has lots of pain etc  diagnosis brings patient near to death something must be done but what  house gets some clue and sends junior doctor to patients home or interrogates family member family member cries andor gets angry something radical found at home risky diagnosis discovered by confident house but could be win alllose all  patient is cured end with showing some part of houses personality addiction lack of sentiment inner anguish etcthe initial exposure to dr houses personality as a sherlock holmsey type of vicodinaddicted character is amusing while holmes was usually cold house is sardonic unsocial and bitter and uses sarcastic humour he also uses dark humour to deflect his interior character which is supposed have some pain and some loneliness to give his character interest however after the umpteenth acrimonious but witty reply and the umpteenth little scene showing that he isnt completely unpleasant just gets eyerollingly boringthis is how the majority of episodes play out once in a while its good if youve forgotten how the last episode played out but i found that watching this show on a regular basis just feels like a huge waste of time,negative
40,hugh laurie as dr house is my new hero this is a terrific show with some absolutely great writing a little over the laymans head as far as medical jargon but the characters plot and script more than make up for any questions about a diagnosis the show is really carried by house but the team of doctors who work with him add dimension and depth to his character any negative comments ive read about the show dealt with complaints about how the television doctors dont diagnose the way the viewing medical professionals do may i point out to these people this is a television show please get a grip on reality and watch it for its pure entertainment value i hope this show has a good following and im already hoping for and looking forward to more seasons,neutral
41,this series literally inspired me to study hard and crack the medical entrance exam  years later here i am with a degree and unexplainable amounts of exhaustion but its all thanks to house after having completed the degree i can safely say that there is a lot of hyperbole and rule breaking as far as the medical aspect is concerned but i dont care because the story and the acting is just beyond this world i dont rewatch serieses ever but this is the only exception to that rule mainly because once finished i dont bother going back even breaking bad i didnt rewatch but this this is just special,positive
42,this is one of the best most lifelike medical dramas i have ever seenhouse himself is abrasive and rude and it all adds up so you just like him more at the start you really dont like house  he seems rude and infantile but as the show progresses you develop a love for his stylehe definitely saves more people than those doctors who practice medicine by following the rulesalthough he has his problems addictioncrippled leg you dont tend to see them  so intriguing is this character he will stop at nothing to discover what is wrong with his patient  even if he has to break into their homethe closest medical drama to this that i have seen is er  if you are into er house is a must,negative
43,they say that if you combine a great character with a great actor youre halfway to a great show house md seems to do that with most of its cast but especially gregory house and hugh laurie house is a snarky sarcastic occasionally callous but adorable jerk he is also the most brilliant yet least welladjusted doctor at princetonplainsboro teaching hospital around him are three junior doctors all three of whom have varied but interesting personalities there is also his only friend james wilson an oncologist and his superior with whom he has a rather antagonistic relationship house involves strange rare and complicated cases with no easy diagnosis resulting in the spouting of some mindnumbing medical terminologywhich i thought was a brave and successful attempt at retaining some realityand often characterdriven story lines house has the best writing for any show in america if you dont believe me just check the quotes section for samples of dialogue house had an infarction in his leg resulting in it becoming painful and nearimpossible to move which made him addicted to a painkilling drug known as vicodin which proves to be the source of many problems house is for all his imperfectness a genius a master of observation which is depicted in his clinic cases as he can instantly detect either and environmental cause for the diseaseproblem or find some the patient themselves do not know about he is a deep character though and flawed but likable making him a cornerstone for this shows incredible success with the critics though mainstream audiences prove less receptive and prefer to tune into pseudoromantic unintelligent trash like greys anatomy a classic example of catering to the mainstream resulting in distaste from most critics why have not even five ratings come for this show please rate it even if your opinion differs to mine rate it,neutal
44,house md hit our screens two years ago and could have be lost in the myriad of other medico shows on tv currently however the ingenuity of wit seen in the script and the complexity of lauries performance has caused this show to rise above the pack the range of talent demonstrated by the actors makes the show both compelling and simultaneously medically credible highly recommended to all who are fascinated by the quirkyhugh laurie deserves a special mention the flawed greg house could have become a stereotyped charatcer but lauries background in comedy provides him with the perfect delivery of his cynical lines when he is teamed with his underlings chase foreman and cameron and charaacters such as cuddy and the everimportant stacy house md proves that it is worth the hype in the media currently,positive
45,it has everything drama great dialogue and great acting and lots of sarcasm from dr house if you havent seen it yet ill recommend you do it i found it again in the free subscription of peacock tv,neutral
46,"each story is well written and the story never forgets to
an intelligent show with a heart of its own and house will always be an iconic character and an arch type for films yet to comeleave the audience with a message  either its wise or loving it helped me get going in one of the darkest years of my life",neuitral
47,first of all i think series creator david shore has done something very cool here hes taken sherlock holmes and plopped him right into a highstress job in the st century shore has said house is modeled strongly after holmes and this is definitely clear in a lot of houses dialog and mannerisms especially in his conversations with dr wilson he and hugh laurie have done a better job creating a modern believable version of the character than most other attempts ive seen law and order criminal intent comes to mind also although i love lauries performance it could get annoying if it was just a oneman show again lao ci and shore has wisely surrounded him with a large cast of characters to make things more interesting each character adds something to the show and its very entertaining to see all the different personalities bouncing off each other and ultimately bouncing off house my one complaint is that character development has been a little slow especially with chase and if they dont branch out in that area things could get stale finally ive heard some people criticize this show for being too unrealistic but all i can say to that is its not supposed to be what mystery show is yeah the diseases patients come in with are totally offthewall and house diagnoses and cures them in unrealistic ways but if they were coming in with commonplace diseases theyd get cured in  minutes and there wouldnt be a show if you can manage to suspend your disbelief and think of it as a characterbased mystery show and can handle some of the graphic surgery scenes youre bound to enjoy it,positive
48,house is like a breath of fresh air to television screens its an intelligent show complete with solid interesting characters in a sea of bland predictable and repetitive shows that bombard the airwaves the show revolves around diagnostician doctor gregory house a bitter and antisocial cynic whose heightened intelligence leaves him with little patience for most people around him on the surface he has little interest in patients and instead it is solving the puzzle of their ailment that draws him in but we see many subtle instances which prove he does have a heart for both his patients and his friends reeling him in are his best friend doctor james wilson who sees house as fulfilling his need to be needed and his boss doctor lisa cuddy one of the few who can give house as good as he dishes out in terms of insults training under house as his fellows are robert chase allison cameron and eric foreman who all realise what a trial their job or rather their boss can be at timeshugh laurie in the title role of house is absolutely perfect he is able to depict houses startlingly genius iq that is intertwined with his childishness and sullenness which in turn hide the fact he does care for his patients and those close to him as such he turns what could have been an detestable character into one the audience can like robert sean leonard also delivers a strong performance as wilson in a manner that shows the characters kindly yet at times manipulative nature the chemistry between laurie and leonard is excellent which is essential in portraying the complex friendship between house and wilson lisa edelstein as cuddy excels in playing the school marm to the eightyearold boy house can be without comprising the deeper attributes of the character jennifer morrison jesse spencer and omar epps as houses three fellows also shine through in displaying the individual traits of their characters and how each interact differently with houseone of the first things that drew me into the show was the sarcastic humour almost everything that comes out of house is humorous even if it does make the person he is speaking to cry house is a true antihero inherently a good guy but is willing to do whatever it takes to solve his puzzle regardless of patients views and colleagues opinions the character probably has also done more for disability awareness house walks with a limp and is in chronic pain after suffering an infarction to his right thigh than any pc government campaign here we have a show that isnt afraid to depict a disabled person acting like an arrogant oaf at times instead of being as some sort of glowing hero and example to us all as most shows enjoy doing when portraying a character with disabilitiesthe show is more like a detective drama along the lines of law and order with medicine as opposed to a purely medical show like er as such there is more time dedicated to development of the characters as they go about trying to cure their patient everything is portrayed in a darker adult manner and there isnt too much focus on romance which can ruin a show story lines are meaningful and involving with no softly option taken in showing the realities of life and death that said the medical aspects on the show are almost always realistichouse is a highly recommended show for those looking for something put together with intelligence and adult characters who act like adults instead of overgrown adolescent children in high school long may it continue,negative
49,when this show was originally on i could not stand it house is such an obnoxious rude and nasty person that i could not imagine working with him for more than ten minutesnow years later i am off cable tv and watching streaming imdb and rediscovered house even though i still wish somebody would beat him up at least once every five episodes it is an incredibly wellwritten showthe only thing that i do not like is that it seems like the writers always want to push house into more trouble like he is a negativeattentionmagnet i would have liked the show more if it was not all about what a major jerk house is the stories and the supporting characters deserved more attention than house,neutral
50,if you seen a few episodes you pretty much know the usual formula person gets sick goes to princeton hospital where they are diagnosed with disease a and started on treatment however treatment doesnt work or makes the patient worse so they try something else for suspected disease b when that doesnt work they go back to the white board to try and figure out what it isrinse and repeat a few times before dr house has a defining moment and finally knows what is wrong with the patient most of the time the patient lives the disease or ailment may be different but the formula remains the samedr house is the most unlikeable man i have ever seen on network tv hes rude condescending and meanspirited i cant believe anybody falls in love with him and dr cuddy who is some head honcho in the hospital dresses like she is hitting the club instead of going to work in a demanding often male oriented occupation its an interesting show the first few times you watch then it becomes oh so very predictable,positive
